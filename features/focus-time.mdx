## What is this?

Whenever you set a [timer](/features/timer), you are accumulating focus
time.

Once you complete the current task, the amount of time spent on the task
will be added to the total focus time (on the top left corner).

## Why is this useful?

Tracking productivity is a great way to stay motivated and focused.

However, manually tracking your productivity is tedious and
time-consuming.

With Focus Time, you can track your productivity
on the fly.

Focus Time can provide great insight when you use the [Wrap
Day](/features/wrap-day) feature.

It can also be used to track and hit your [Daily Goal](/features/daily-goal).
