## What is this?

When you start your day, your Complish will display something like the
screenshot above.

It shows the previous day's [focus time](/features/focus-time), and automatically pre-fill
today's goal for you.

You can edit the goal, and then start your day.

## Goal Tracking

Once you start your day, you'll see a radial progress bar at the
top-left of your screen.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/daily-goal-tracking-unhovered.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>
<Info>
  The fire icon in the screenshot indicates that the user has broken her
  personal record.
</Info>

You can hover over the focus time card and/or the radial progress bar to see more details:

    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Why is this useful?

Setting a goal and tracking it is a great way to stay motivated and
focused.

We hope this feature prompts you to use the [timer](/features/timer) more
accurately.
