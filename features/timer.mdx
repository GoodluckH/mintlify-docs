## Preset Timer

When you create a new task, simply type in a number at the end to indicate the timer associated.

The number indicates minutes.

    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>


## Old Timer

You will see this kind of timer when you don't preset a time.

Before doing your task, select a time from the button group.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-button-group.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

If you need more than 30 minutes, click the `+` button to add more time.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-slider.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>
We set a max time of 2 hours because we highly recommend breaking down tasks into
smaller chunks to help you focus and reduce stress.

<Info>
  Ideally, each task should take 30 minutes at max. Anything longer can likely
  be broken down.

## Banner

When you are focusing on your task, we want to minimize distractions.

We designed the banner to give you a sense of time using your peripheral
vision.

There are different colors indicating different states.

### Yellow

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-yellow-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates the timer is active for a regular task.

### Blue

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-blue-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates the timer is active for a [break](/features/breaks) task.

### Green

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-green-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates time is up for the current task.
