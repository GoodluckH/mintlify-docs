## Basics

Before doing your task, select a time from the button group.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-button-group.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

If you need more than 30 minutes, click the `+` button to add more time.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-slider.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>
We set a max time of 2 hours because we highly recommend breaking down tasks into
smaller chunks to help you focus and reduce stress.

<Info>
  Ideally, each task should take 30 minutes at max. Anything longer can likely
  be broken down.
</Info>

## Controls

</Frame>

Once a timer is active, you will have three control buttons for the
timer.

From left to right, they are: **Pause/Resume**, **Cancel**, and **Add 5**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resume/Pause">Pause or resume the timer.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cancel Timer">
    Cancel and reset the timer. Usually this is used when you had picked a wrong
    time for the current task.
    <Warning>
      This action cannot be undone. The [focus time](/features/focus-time) for the current task will be
      reset.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add 5">
    Add 5 minutes to the current timer. This is useful when you need a little
    more time to finish the current task.

    <Warning>
    We discourage users from using this button too often. If you find yourself
    using this button frequently, consider breaking down your tasks into smaller chunks.
    </Warning>

## Banner

When you are focusing on your task, we want to minimize distractions.

We designed the banner to give you a sense of time using your peripheral
vision.

There are different colors indicating different states.

### Yellow

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-yellow-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates the timer is active for a regular task.

### Blue

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-blue-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates the timer is active for a [break](/features/breaks) task.

### Green

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/timer-green-banner.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

This indicates time is up for the current task.
